AI-Powered Study Plan Generator

Project Overview:
We are proud to present the AI-Powered Study Plan Generator, a project developed by me and my amazing teammate Om Singh for the PRASUNETHON Hackathon 2024, organized by PRASUNET. This project leverages Gemini technology to create an innovative and intelligent study plan generator.

Key Features:
Intelligent Agents
Our project integrates three intelligent agents, each with a specific role:

1. Planning Agent: Creates personalized study plans based on user input and preferences.
2. Blog Sourcing Agent: Identifies and sources relevant blog articles to supplement the study material.
3. YouTube Video Curation Agent: Curates and links pertinent YouTube videos to enhance understanding of each study plan section.

RAG System:
The project includes a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that links blog articles and YouTube videos to each section of the study plan. This integration enhances interactive learning by providing diverse resources and perspectives.

Solve Doubts and Test Feature:
To ensure comprehensive and effective study support, we implemented a feature that allows users to:

1. Solve Doubts: Users can input their doubts and receive detailed explanations and solutions.
2. Test Knowledge: Users can take tests to assess their understanding and readiness.
