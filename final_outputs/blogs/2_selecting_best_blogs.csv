There are several algorithms under supervised machine learning and one of them is Linear Regression.In this post, you will come across a brief note on the introduction for linear regression, types of linear regression, assumptions of linear regression, how linear regression works, methods for estimating the coefficient and the intercept and implementing the model in python.Introduction to linear regressionIn machine learning under the category of supervised machine learning, linear regression is one of the simplest parametric methods that you can apply to a dataset to model the relationship between the dependent variable (or response variable) and one or more independent variables(or explanatory variables).In linear regression, the values of the dependent variable are continuous in nature. The linear regression is used for forecasting, time-series data, identifying the cause and effect relationship and many more.Types of Linear RegressionSimple Linear Regression: If there is only one independent variable then it is Simple Linear Regression.Multiple Linear Regression: If there are two or more independent variables then it is called Multiple Linear Regression.Assumptions of Linear RegressionLinearity: There must be a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.Homoscedasticity or homogeneity: The residuals(or error terms) must possess a constant variance, regardless of the independent variable.Lack of multicollinearity: There must be no correlation between the independent variables.Independent of residuals(or error): The residuals must be independent of each"

By Kanwal Mehreen, KDnuggets Technical Editor & Content Specialist on September 18, 2023 in Machine Learning Image by Author Basic Overview Linear regression is the fundamental supervised machine learning algorithm for predicting the continuous target variables based on the input features. As the name suggests it assumes that the relationship between the dependant and independent variable is linear. So if we try to plot the dependent variable Y against the independent variable X, we will obtain a straight line. The equation of this line can be represented by: Where, Y Predicted output. X = Input feature or feature matrix in multiple linear regression b0 = Intercept (where the line crosses the Y-axis). b1 = Slope or coefficient that determines the line's steepness."

In the earlier blog, Your guide to Supervised Machine Learning  Regression, we got an insight into what regression is and how we can make models required in regression; we learned about simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression. Today we will be going through classification and different basic models used for classification. We will get a theoretical view of how these models work and then dive into the mathematics behind these algorithms. Don't worry; we will be keeping this as simple and easy as possible. So let us begin !!!ClassificationMost of the tasks in our daily life may be choosing whether to go out or not, whether we will be able to do something or not, what color an object is, and even what the thing is; these are all classifications. As a human, it is necessary to classify objects correctly.Furthermore, if we are speaking of making a program similar to humans, it must be essential to classify things. Now, if we go into mathematical terms as discussed in the previous blog, ""classification means to predict discrete variables or to tell the category of objects."" Broadly classification can be divided into Binary classification and multi-class classification.Binary classification: As the name suggests, it means to classify in two classes or categories ( Remember, it is a convention to use classes for discrete categories in machine learning ). It is like We ask our program to answer ""YES"" or ""NO.""Multi-class classification: Multi-class classification is when we have to predict more"

While problems in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning can be of various types, they can be broadly classified into three categories:Supervised Learning:The system is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a teacher, and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.Unsupervised Learning:No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input. Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).Reinforcement Learning:A system interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent). The system is provided feedback in terms of rewards and punishments as it navigates its problem space.Between supervised and unsupervised learning is semi-supervised learning, where the teacher gives an incomplete training signal: a training set with some (often many) of the target outputs missing. We will focus on unsupervised learning and data clustering in this blog post.Unsupervised LearningIn some pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vectors x without any corresponding target values.

We will first start looking at how the algorithm works, then we will implement it using NumPy, and finally, we will look at implementing it using Scikit-learn.IntroductionK-means clustering is an unsupervised algorithm that groups unlabelled data into different clusters. The K in its title represents the number of clusters that will be created. This is something that should be known prior to the model training. For example, if K=4 then 4 clusters would be created, and if K=7 then 7 clusters would be created. The k-means algorithm is used in fraud detection, error detection, and confirming existing clusters in the real world.The algorithm is centroid-based, meaning that each data point is assigned to the cluster with the closest centroid. This algorithm can be used for any number of dimensions as we calculate the distance to centroids using the euclidian distance. More on this in the next section.The benefits of the k-means algorithm are that it is easy to implement, it scales to large datasets, it will always converge, and it fits clusters with varying shapes and sizes. Some disadvantages of the model are that the number of clusters is chosen manually, the clusters are dependent on initial values, and that it is sensitive to outliers.K-means StepsThe steps of training a K-means model can be broken down into 6 steps.Step 1: Determine the number of clusters (K=?)It is best if K is known before model training, but if not, there are strategies to find K. The most common is the elbow method, which plots the sum of the squared distances as K increases. By"

Unlike Supervised Machine Learning in this, we identify the data points in relation to other data points because this type of Machine Learning Algorithm does not make use of Labelled Data as it does in Supervised Machine Learning. If you need more clarification on the topic, try reading the Unsupervised Machine learning section of (Getting Familiar to the World of Machine Learning).Unsupervised Machine LearningUnsupervised Machine Learning is used when we need to find out underlying hidden patterns in an Unlabelled Dataset, Unsupervised Machine Learning is further classified into two sections:Clustering  Grouping of similar data points to form different cultures.Association  Finding important relations between data points.In this blog, we will be learning how clustering works and what methodologies can we use to perform clustering over Unlabelled Data.ClusteringSuppose you are presented with a basket full of flowers, and the basket can contain any number of different categories of flowers. For example, the basket may contain 5 flowers of type-1, 3 flowers of type-2 etc. The catch here is that you have Blindfolds on, and you can not see and distinguish between categories of flowers. Now how would you differentiate one type of flower from others?Since you can not take the blindfold off, one way to distinguish between different types of flowers is to pick one flower and place it out of the basket, pick another flower and try to feel if it is similar to the"

The intention of this blog post is to act as a paved road to the mountain base camp  that is, help you get a look at the whole mountain before you go for metaphorical hike. There are a lot of blogs about individual unsupervised learning techniques but something I wished I had when I started learning about unsupervised learning was a high level comparison of the main unsupervised learning clustering methods.The goal of clustering is to segment the population into smaller, differentiable segments. I have seen clustering analysis being described as not having a specific goal in mind, but that undersells both the algorithms and the data scientist executing them. The goal  or purpose of executing the algorithm is set by the data scientist writing and executing the code. So as a heads up  unsupervised learning does require a lot of interpretation on the part of the data scientist.In this article I wont be using numbers or code. Instead, I will compare the three main approaches to clustering (hierarchal, centroid, or density based) using a symbolic example with the characters from the 2004 film Mean Girls. If youre not familiar with the movie, I recommend a quick read of the review. But really, all you need to know is that in the movie, Cady is a new girl trying to fit into an existing High school social organizationThe Set UpImagine you are the principal at a highschool.

Two crucial techniques in unsupervised learning are clustering and dimensionality reduction. In this blog post, we will delve into these concepts, understanding their significance, applications, and how they are transforming the landscape of data analysis.Clustering:Clustering is a method used to group similar data points together based on certain features or characteristics, without any prior knowledge of the groupings. Imagine having a collection of diverse documents and wanting to categorize them into topics without predefined labels. Clustering algorithms, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, come to the rescue.K-means clustering, for instance, partitions data into k clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid. The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest centroid and updates the centroid based on the mean of the assigned points. This process repeats until convergence, creating distinct clusters within the data.Applications of Clustering:1. Customer Segmentation in Marketing:Clustering helps identify homogeneous groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior, allowing businesses to tailor marketing strategies for each segment.2. Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity:By clustering normal patterns in network traffic, any deviations from these patterns can be easily detected as potential security threats.3. Genomic Data Analysis:Clustering aids in categorizing genes with similar expression patterns, providing insights into"

It recently gained popularity through its ability to achieve superhuman-levels of play in games like Go, Chess, Dota, and StarCraft II.In this article, Ive put together a list of 7 examples where reinforcement learning is being applied in real-world use cases.1. Autonomous driving with WayveApproaches to self-driving cars have historically involved defining logic rules. This can be difficult to scale out to the countless number of situations that might be encountered by autonomous vehicles on public roads. This is where deep reinforcement learning may be promising.Wayve is a UK-based company that has been testing autonomous vehicles on public roads since 2018. In their paper, 'Learning to Drive in a Day', they describe how they used deep reinforcement learning to train a model using a monocular image as input. The reward was the distance travelled by the vehicle without the safety driver taking control. The model was trained in a driving simulation and then deployed in the real world on a 250-meter section of road.While their autonomous vehicle technology continues to evolve, they claim that reinforcement learning continues to play a part in motion planning (ensuring the existence of a feasible"

In this blog, we will embark on a journey to demystify the concept of predicting housing prices using machine learning. From understanding the basics to exploring a hands-on example, we will unravel the layers of regression models and the role of natural language processing in this intriguing domain.The Basics: House Price Prediction and RegressionFor a newcomer, predicting house prices might seem like peering into a crystal ball. In reality, it involves leveraging historical data and patterns to estimate the future value of a property. Real estate agents, property developers, and even individuals looking to buy or sell a house can benefit from these predictions.Pros and Cons of Regression Models:Pros: Regression models, like Linear Regression, offer simplicity and interpretability. They can capture relationships between variables and provide valuable insights.Cons: However, they might oversimplify complex relationships and struggle with non-linear patterns in data.The Role of DescriptionsOne interesting aspect is the use of house descriptions in predictions. Descriptions, often rich in detail, provide additional context. Including them in the model allows for a more nuanced understanding of how certain features impact house prices.Machine Learning Enters the ArenaNow, lets delve into the integration of machine learning into the house price prediction process. Our focus is on the California Housing dataset, a goldmine for data enthusiasts.In our example, we employ a Linear Regression model. This choice is driven by its simplicity, interpretability, and suitability for this type of"
