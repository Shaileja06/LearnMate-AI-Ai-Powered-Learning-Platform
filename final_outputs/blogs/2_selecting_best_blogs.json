Thats pretty much the deal!At a very basic level, deep learning is a machine learning technique. It teaches a computer to filter inputs through layers to learn how to predict and classify information. Observations can be in the form of images, text, or sound.The inspiration for deep learning is the way that the human brain filters information. Its purpose is to mimic how the human brain works to create some real magic.GIF via GIPHYDeep learning attempts to mimic the activity in layers of neurons in the neocortex.Its very literally an artificial neural network.In the human brain, there are about 100 billion neurons. Each neuron connects to about 100,000 of its neighbors. That is what were trying to create, but in a way and at a level that works for machines.Image by geralt on PixabayWhat does this mean in terms of neurons, axons, dendrites, and so on? Well, the neuron has a body, dendrites, and an axon. The signal from one neuron travels down the axon and transfers to the dendrites of the next neuron. That connection where the signal passes is called a synapse.Image by mohamed_hassan on PixabayNeurons by themselves are kind of useless. But when you have lots of them, they work together to create some serious magic. Thats the idea behind a deep learning algorithm! You get input from observation and you put your input into one layer. That layer creates an output which in turn becomes the input for"}, {"https://dell-research-harvard.github.io/intro/2023/01/18/lecture1.html": "Melissa Dell | An Introduction to Deep Learning Melissa Dell Research Resources Teaching Knowledge Base Team An Introduction to Deep Learning January 18, 2023 - 2 minute read - Category: Intro - Tags: Deep learning Topics This post covers the first lecture in the course: An Introduction to Deep Learning. This lecture will begin by setting the stage for why deep learning is necessary. When curating data at scale, there are generally two approaches: human-designed rules and deep learning. While well see throughout the course that the judicious use of rules has its place in many big data endeavors, generally the performance of rule-based methods is disappointing in comparison to deep learning. The lecture will provide a couple of case studies of deep learning applied to economic data. We will then turn to an overview of neural networks. For those who need to brush up on deep learning methods, the online text Neural Networks and Deep Learning provides an introduction to the main concepts and how they relate. Deep Learning by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville is the standard reference in the field. It is best suited to those who have some basic familiarity with deep learning. Part I provides a solid introduction to the concepts in applied math that are required to understand deep learning (students in the course should be familiar with this material, but the book is a good refresher). I recommend the book Deep Learning with PyTorch to anyone who does not already have extensive familiarity with PyTorch. There are also numerous lectures available for free online.

There is always so much to do. Before even starting to train the data, a lot needs to be decided, from fixing the number of input-output units to deciding which activation and optimization to use and worst, when and where to do what. In machine learning things are quite streamlined, all thanks to the sci-kit learn library, where after some pre-processing of the data, all you have to do is to instantiate the learner then train and fit your data in one step, get the predictions and find the accuracy. In just three or four blissful short and crisp steps, you are done with a simple machine learning model. But unfortunately things arent so simple for crafting deep learning models. Of course there is a reason for you to select this computationally extensive, complex architecture, since the extent of non-linearity in your data and your objective might be too complex for an ML algorithm to learn and solve. So I have tried to chart the general steps in deep learning that any architect have to go through regardless of the architecture. Of course this is a generic way of explaining, but sometimes a roadmap really helps for an absolute beginner. I have jotted down the highlights of the discussion in this article in a diagram in the end and now let us get started.Grab your dataAs a beginner, I have mostly trusted Kaggle for my deep learning data and the best part is, you can go through the notebooks of what others have submitted, if you are unsure of how to approach the data.

Its too easy to give up.Dont stop. Dont give up.Have you paid careful attention while training your deep learning network, or have you just randomly picked the things and put them on training?While training, it is assumed that the model will learn the subset of data called training set; so the model gradually optimizers to achieve the desired assumption on the testing set. The goal of training is to learn enough on the training set or training data so that it can make predictions about the testing set or testing data. Training a deep learning model requires time and attention. It seems a pretty simple process to train a model, collect data, preprocess it, design a model and put the data for training. It is not that simple. This lack of understanding can do more harm than good to you. You need to know some techniques and practices before putting the data on training. If you know the techniques beforehand, you can work with deep learning libraries of your choice, PyTorch or Keras, after doing some hands-on. It is not a big deal.The frequent questions while training a neural network that may come to your mind are why my learning process gets stuck or stops or, in other words, why weights are not updating, why the loss is not decreasing, why the accuracy of the model is too low. If you are facing similar questions, you are at the right place to learn the best practices of training the network. If you do not know the best practices, you will face the same problem again and again and will stick on the same for many days.

What do you see? You might think this is a trivial question  clearly, its a yellow banana casting a shadow on a pink background. But how might computers recognize this image without having eyes and brains like humans do?Computers arent able to infer about the world intuitively like we do, so for computers to see and recognize objects, scientists have to crack the complex system that is the human brain and implement it onto a computer. As children, we have an innate curiosity to explore and experiment with the world. We stumble upon unfamiliar objects, interact with and learn about them, and over time make inferences about things like whether that object is dangerous or harmless.For computers to learn and extrapolate information similarly, we either program a set of rules for them to follow in a process called supervised learning, or we give them the answers and they try to understand what was the initial question or goal, or unsupervised learning. With both methods, its a major challenge to encode the right rules or give the right format of answers for computers to see images.However, with recent advancements in deep learning, computers can now recognize and classify images and even videos with impressive accuracy.
